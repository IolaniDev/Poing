# iobot

iobot is a schedule data app designed for use at ['Iolani School](https://www.iolani.org/).  Originally designed by the folks in [AgencyAgency](https://github.com/AgencyAgency)'s iOS Design and Development class, this project is now maintained by the ['IolaniDev team](https://github.com/IolaniDev), which is comprised of various ['Iolani](https://www.iolani.org/) students and faculty from the [Sullivan Center for Innovation and Leadership](https://www.iolani.org/about/sullivan-center).

## Update for the 2020-21 school year
Due to the uncertainty around the school calendar and need to make changes quickly depending on the COVID-19 situation during the 2020-21 school year, we have made the decision not to update iobot for the 2020-21 school year.  We sincerely apologize for any convenience and hope we can bring the app back in some form during the 2021-22 school year.
